    <p>A Recursive function that "calls itself during its execution".recursive function are commonly used in programming
    when a problem can be broken down into smaaller ,identical sub-problems.each recursive call process a smaller 
    instance of the prblm until a base case is reached,"at which point the function stops calling itself nd returns a result".</p>
